# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts future stock prices based on historical market data including **Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV)** features. The dataset is collected using **Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)**, and multiple machine learning models are applied to forecast stock closing prices.
ðŸ”¹ Features
- Data collection via `yfinance`
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with attractive visualizations
- Machine Learning models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Model evaluation using **RÂ² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Comparison of actual vs predicted stock prices
 ðŸ”¹ Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- yfinance  
- xgboost
- ðŸ”¹ Results
- Achieved **80â€“90% accuracy (RÂ² Score)** using Random Forest and XGBoost.  
- Visualizations clearly show **Actual vs Predicted** trends for stock closing prices.
